## Overview
### What is a Developer Portfolio?

A Developer Portfolio is a website that showcases your skills, experience and work to prospective employers. It
is similar in ways to a portfolio that an artist or photographer might create - they collate some example projects to
show what sort of work they do. It's also a bit like a CV, as there will be aspects of talking about yourself and
your background; but instead of just talking about your work, you can show what you've built!

### Why am I building one now?

- You will need a portfolio to find/get a job as it will help you to stand out.
- It is easier to build one now since the frontend course material will still be fresh on your minds.
- It is great practice for the skills you have been learning.
- This will also prepare you for when you gain access to Boolean's Career Services, as they can help you to refine
  the portfolio.

### How do I make one?

The best way is to build one yourself! This way, even the portfolio site itself is a demonstration of your skills
and experience.

First, plan your portfolio! Do some research on designs, think about what content you want to include, structure the
very high-level layout of the site, etc. Check out the 
[Where can I find examples or inspiration?](#where-can-i-find-examples-or-inspiration) section below.

Next, build it! What you use to build it is up to you, and it will generally be one of:

- A static website using just HTML, CSS and JS;
- A React Single Page App (SPA) - i.e. it has no routing;
- A React app with routing.

> At this stage, it is NOT advised to build something with a new language or framework. Save this for the projects
> that you want to showcase in the portfolio!

Use [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) 
to help you create a new GitHub repository for your portfolio

In terms of the content to include, at a very high level, you will want to include:

- **Biography/Self-Intro** - a paragraph or two about you.
- **Tech Stack** - the languages/technologies that you have experience with.
- **Education / Experience** - only those that are relevant to coding / the line of work you want to go into.
- **Projects** - sites/apps that you have built.
  - You should aim to have at least 3 and no more than 5 projects to showcase.
  - Try to add as much variety to the projects you choose as possible.
  - Include a short description of what it does; the tech you used; and a link to the GitHub repo.
  - EITHER include a link to the deployed online version OR add screenshots, short clips, GIFs, etc. of a
    localhost version from your computer.
  - Avoid including exercises from the course or apps built from tutorials.
  - Challenges from the course could be included as these involved less guidance but having something unique would
    still be better to help you stand out from the crowd.
  - You will also have time to build and add more later!

## Instructions
You should create your portfolio in a new repo on your own account. But to make it easier for teachers and staff to 
access your portfolio, please do the following:
- [ ] Fork this repo, and clone the forked version from your GitHub account
- [ ] Rename this `README.md` file to something else (e.g. `INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
- [ ] Create a new file called `README.md`, and include the following content sections (complete them as and when 
  you are able to):
  - About My Portfolio Project
    - Planning & Inspiration _(e.g. include drawings, diagrams, links to sites used to get ideas, etc.)_
    - Tech Stack _(i.e. what technology / frameworks / libraries you used)_
    - Why This Stack
  - Links 
    - Online Hosted Portfolio
    - Portfolio GitHub Repo
- [ ] Stage, commit and push your changes; then raise a PR -- as per the usual process
- [ ] If any information changes, update it, and push your changes (especially important for the links)

> **NOTE:** We do not want you to use the fork of this repo to host your portfolio project code! Create a new 
> dedicated repo for it from your own account.

### Where can I find examples or inspiration?

Here are some sites to check out:

- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae/

### How do I deploy my site to the internet?

There are various approaches, and it depends on what sort of site/application you have built.

- **Static Website** - The simplest solution is to host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is
  nice and simple, and will allow you to link your GitHub repos to GitHub pages,
  which will then host the site/project for you.
- **React Single Page App (SPA)** - If you have a React app with no routing, then there are two options: You can either:
  1. Use GitHub Pages as above, but you will also need to include the `gh-pages` package. Follow the instructions
     provided [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/deploying-react-apps-github-pages/) but bear in mind the following:
     - Where they use `create-react-app` (CRA), you should use `vite` (CRA is an obsolete React project initialiser)
     - You should check out additional setup instructions for `vite`
       [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages)
  2. Use Netlify, as per the instructions below for "React with Routing".
- **React with Routing** - If you have routing, then this is the best approach. It is also a good option if you have 
  a React SPA with no routing. It requires a bit of setup so follow the guides carefully!
  - [Freecodecamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-react-router-based-app-to-netlify/)
    - It is NOT advised to use the "Drag and Drop the Build Folder in Netlify" approach
    - The "How to Deploy an App to Netlify from a GitHub Repository" approach is better
    - Beware that this is from 2021 so some things may have changed
  - [Netlify web instructions](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/)
    - These are the official Netlify instructions on how to use their web interface to link your GitHub repo to their platform
      so that you can create a "Continuous Deployment" - meaning the deployed website will automatically update to match what
      is contained in your repo!
  - [Netlify CLI instructions](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/vite/#deploy-your-vite-project-with-netlify-cli)
    - These are the official Netlify instructions for deploying a React app built using `vite`.
    - It involves installing their Command Line Interface (CLI), which is a programme that you run from your 
      terminal / GitBash.
    - This is an alternative approach to using the web deployment approach above. Use one approach or the other - NOT BOTH!

  > Whichever Netlify  guide you follow, be sure to do the steps fo adding a `_redirects` file to enable both React SPA 
  > and React with Routing apps to work properly.
